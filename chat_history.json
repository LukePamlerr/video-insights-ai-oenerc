The design should feel advanced but easy to use \u2014 a place where creativity meets automation.\r\n\r\nOn the homepage, users can paste multiple YouTube links at once. The system fetches each video\u2019s title, thumbnail, and duration, then begins real-time analysis. AI detects emotional peaks, funny scenes, impactful dialogue, and visually strong moments. Using audio tone, facial motion, and speech analysis, it identifies high-engagement timestamps and ranks them.\r\n\r\nEach video generates highlight clips ranging from 15\u201390 seconds. Users can preview, trim, and download them instantly \u2014 no login or payment required. The AI also provides short summaries, keyword insights, and hashtag suggestions for each clip, making them ready for YouTube Shorts, TikTok, or Instagram Reels.\r\n\r\nA batch dashboard displays progress for all videos with smooth progress bars and status indicators.

You want to build a professional, AI-powered mobile app using React Native and Expo 54 that analyzes YouTube links and extracts engaging moments.

Display video titles, thumbnails, and durations as they are fetched.\n*   **Analysis and Highlight Generation:** Implement the core AI analysis to detect key moments (emotional peaks, funny scenes, etc.) and generate highlight clips. Display progress for each video.\n*   **Highlight Clip Preview and Download:** Allow users to preview the generated highlight clips and download them instantly.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#000000` (Black)\n    *   Text: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   textSecondary: `#A9A9A9` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#FF0000` (Red)\n    *   Secondary: `#1E1E1E` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Accent: `#FF4500` (Orange Red)\n    *   Card: `#121212` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD700` (Gold)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for readability.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create a new component for the YouTube link input and display.** This component will handle pasting multiple links, fetching video information (title, thumbnail, duration), and displaying them in a list.\n2.  **Implement the AI analysis and highlight generation.** This is the core functionality of the app and will require integrating with an AI service or library. For now, we can mock this functionality with placeholder data.\n3.  **Create a component to display the generated highlight clips.** This component will allow users to preview the clips and download them.\n4.  **Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file** to incorporate the new components and functionality.

Here's a breakdown of how to approach this and some design considerations:\n\nSince the app is currently displaying nothing, the first step is to ensure the basic structure is in place and that components are rendering correctly.\n\n1.  **Verify Entry Point:** Check `app/_layout.tsx` to ensure it's correctly setting up the navigation and rendering the initial screen. Confirm that the `<Stack>` component is present and configured.\n2.  **Inspect Home Screen:** Examine `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to see if the main content of your home screen is being rendered. Look for any conditional rendering that might be preventing content from displaying.\n3.  **Check Component Rendering:** Ensure that the components you're using (e.g., `FloatingTabBar`, `ListItem`, `IconSymbol`) are correctly implemented and that they are receiving the necessary props.\n4.  **Review Styles:** Verify that your styles in `styles/commonStyles.ts` and component-specific styles are not causing elements to be hidden or rendered off-screen.\n5.  **Error Logging:** Utilize `utils/errorLogger.ts` to catch and log any errors that might be occurring during rendering. Check the console for any error messages.\n6.  **React Navigation:** If you are using React Navigation, ensure that the navigation stack is correctly set up and that the initial route is defined.\n\nBy systematically checking these areas, you should be able to identify the cause of the blank screen and get your app up and running.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-04T10:48:07.679327"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the issue where nothing is showing up in your app. Let me first understand the current structure and identify the problem."}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I can see the issue!
