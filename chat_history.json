Confirm that the `<Stack>` component is present and configured.\n2.  **Inspect Home Screen:** Examine `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to see if the main content of your home screen is being rendered. Look for any conditional rendering that might be preventing content from displaying.\n3.  **Check Component Rendering:** Ensure that the components you're using (e.g., `FloatingTabBar`, `ListItem`, `IconSymbol`) are correctly implemented and that they are receiving the necessary props.\n4.  **Review Styles:** Verify that your styles in `styles/commonStyles.ts` and component-specific styles are not causing elements to be hidden or rendered off-screen.\n5.  **Error Logging:** Utilize `utils/errorLogger.ts` to catch and log any errors that might be occurring during rendering. Check the console for any error messages.\n6.  **React Navigation:** If you are using React Navigation, ensure that the navigation stack is correctly set up and that the initial route is defined.\n\nBy systematically checking these areas, you should be able to identify the cause of the blank screen and get your app up and running.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-04T10:48:07.679327"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the issue where nothing is showing up in your app. Let me first understand the current structure and identify the problem."}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I can see the issue!

Consider using cloud-based AI platforms for video analysis.\n*   **Clip Extraction and Download:** Once you've identified the highlight timestamps, you'll need to extract those segments from the video. This might involve using libraries or services that can manipulate video files. Then, you'll need to provide a download mechanism for the user to save the clips.\n*   **Enhancements:** Implement the extra features like keyword extraction, auto-subtitle generation, highlight reel builder, and smart thumbnail picker using appropriate AI services or libraries.\n\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-04T10:52:02.201719"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement real YouTube API integration with AI-powered highlight extraction.
